# Space-Invaders-on-Arduino-UNO-Board
An implementation of the classic 1970s game Space Invaders written in embedded C++. Implemented using the Arduino UNO R3 board with the Atmega328p microcontroller and ST7735 protocol SPI LCD display. Embedded systems concepts such as task scheduling, SPI protocol for communication with peripheral devices, analog to digital conversion, and other concepts were implemented to achieve a working game. The game was made for a project assignment in the CS120B Intro to Embedded Systems class in the University of California, Riverside (Spring 2024).
